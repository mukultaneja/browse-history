# Browse History

Browse History is a tool which can help us to analyze and visulaize the history of our browser. It helps us to know where and how much time we are spending over the internet. Each and every browser gives a history page to see what links we have visited over internet so far and we can filter them out based on some filters, But, sometimes it seems very hard to filter out a web link which we tend to forget with elapse of time.

Browe History provides a list of overall browser history so far along with multiple options using them we can filter out results according to our need, for example

`--address` filter sets a flag to filter out result based on a domain name

`--startdate` filter sets a flag to filter out result from a start date

`--enddate` filter sets a flag to filter out result till an end date. It sets current date as a value for filter the results

`--limit` filter sets a flag to limit out the list of results. It sets 20 as a default value for limit out the results

`--title` filter sets a flag to filter out result based title of the web page

Currently, I am working on the visualization part for this tool and I will be releasing this tool soon as a full fledged application which can be used on multiple operating systems and browsers.
